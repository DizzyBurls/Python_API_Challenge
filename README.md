# Python_API_Challenge

    Homework Task 6
    Writen by Chris Burley

# Name of Project:

    Homework Task 6
    Part Names: (1) WeatherPy   (2) VacationPy

# Description:

	In this project I have written scripts which, to my knowledge, satisfy every section of the two tasks. 
	See screen captures 1 - 15 which I have uploaded to this repository. They show main features that we were required to create.

# Activation of a script:

	To run these scripts: 

	(1) Open the Jupyter Source Files (weatherpy and vacatiopy) which can be found in my Git Hub repository.

    (2) Add you own API keys to the api_keys file provided.

	(2) Run each notebook in Jupyter.
    
	(3) Run the scripts in the order that they appear.
